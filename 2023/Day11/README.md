# Day 11

The last few days are missing prompt history. I'll try to track them down, I recall using many prompts, and being fairly frustrated at my approach. I thought I'd change it up a little, 
and break down the problem for the LLM. I was a lot more successful today.

## Prompt 1

The input includes empty space (.) and galaxies (#).  Here is an example: 
```
...#......
.......#..
#.........
..........
......#...
.#........
.........#
..........
.......#..
#...#....
```

Write a javascript program to sum of the lengths of the shortest path between every pair of galaxies. 

## Prompt 2
Good. Now modify the program so that before you calculate the short paths, any rows or columns that contain no galaxies should all actually be twice as big. So in the input given, the input should be modified by a function called expandUniverse, and it should look like this: 
```
....#........
.........#...
#............
.............
.............
........#....
.#...........
............#
.............
.............
.........#...
#....#.......
```

## Prompt 3
So for the expandUniverse function, the "doubling" actually means just add a new row to right (if it is a column) or below, (if it is a row).

This was enough to solve Part 1.

## Prompt 4
Good. Now modify the expandUniverse function so that instead of adding a another row, each empty row should be replaced with 1000000 empty rows, and each empty column should be replaced with 1000000 empty columns.

The LLM correctly calls out the issue with memory usage, and provides a theoretical solution.

## Prompt 5
You're correct in your assumption. The expanded rows and columns contain no galaxies. Rewrite the program with this in mind.

##
(off by one error)
Okay, that's not quite right. Let's try two examples if we were to expand by 10, then the value should be 1030. If we were to expand by 100, then the value should be 8410.

That was enough to get the second gold star.
