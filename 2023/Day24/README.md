# Day 24

Whew, finally made it to the "last" day. 

Part 1 was a 4 prompter today. Largely it was just a matter of tweaking the prompts to follow the instructions. Although, I knew what was coming when 
the story mentioned, "ignore z-axis".  ðŸ¤”

Part 2 took a few prompts for me to discover the Least Squares approach. As I continued to propmt, CGpt eventualy just say 'use python', and then proceeded
to provide a sympy solution. My contribution here, as to prompt to use different libraries, and to limit the input to 5 lines. The "solution", essentially 
abstracted the hard problem away. The code compares the rockâ€™s position over time to the particleâ€™s position over time for each axis (X, Y, Z). 
Given the high cardinality of the particle positions, I assumed that solving for 2 particles would provide valid positions for the remainder.
