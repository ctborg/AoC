# Advent of Code 2024 Solutions

Welcome to my **Advent of Code 2024** repository! ðŸŽ„âœ¨

[Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/2024) is an annual event featuring daily programming challenges throughout December, designed to test problem-solving skills and celebrate the joy of coding.

## My Approach

This year, I'm building on my experience from [Advent of Code 2023](https://github.com/ctborg/AoC/tree/master/2023), where I used **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to assist in solving the challenges. For 2024, I'm refining my process and comparing the results to last year's efforts.

### Tools I'm Using:
- **Gemini (Paid Access):** Utilizing its advanced reasoning capabilities for deeper problem analysis and debugging.
- **ChatGPT-4 Turbo (OpenAI):** Assisting with code generation, optimization, and iterative refinement.

### Comparing 2023 vs. 2024:
In 2023, I discovered that:
- LLMs excel at quickly generating solutions to well-defined problems but sometimes struggle with ambiguous or edge-case-heavy challenges.
- Combining insights from multiple LLMs often produced better results than relying on one.

For 2024, I aim to:
- Better integrate LLM outputs with my own debugging and optimization process.
- Evaluate whether Gemini and ChatGPT-4 Turbo offer noticeable improvements compared to last year's tools.
- Track the time saved and challenges solved collaboratively versus solo efforts.

## How It Works:
1. **Problem Breakdown:** I'll use LLMs to quickly interpret problem descriptions, identify edge cases, and outline solution strategies.
2. **Code Assistance:** AI will help write initial code snippets, optimize solutions, and explain concepts when needed.
3. **Human Touch:** I'll refine, validate, and integrate these AI-assisted solutions to ensure accuracy and creativity.

## Why LLMs?
- Speed up repetitive or boilerplate coding.
- Explore different algorithms or approaches faster.
- Gain insights into obscure problems or concepts.

## Note:
While LLMs play a significant role, this is a collaborative effort between human intuition and AI. Every solution will be manually reviewed and refined for quality and correctness.
