Three prompts to complete. 

The first was to parse the input.

```
I have an input like this: "13237   28305
34736   99523
95583   12965
34797   36285
47199   88293
20631   56266".

Write a javascript function to split the left and right sides into separate arrays.
```

The second and third prompts were essentially the problems as presented.

Total time spent on both parts: 3 minutes.
